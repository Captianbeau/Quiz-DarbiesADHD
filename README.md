# Darbie’s ADHD Quiz


## Description

I wanted a fun quiz of random topics that I’ve learned. It contains questions about cats, bugs, the carboniferous period and color pigmentation. It takes the scores of previous players and adds them to a list so others can compare their scores to them! There are 60 second to complete the quiz and every wrong answer removes 10 seconds.
